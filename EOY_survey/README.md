Point(s) of View and Supporting Evidence
Gtmhub’s platform
🟢 💡 Continue emphasizing features related to usability and customization in order to “bump-up” NPS edge cases (detractor→passive, passive→promotor) and boost Gtmhub’s overall NPS metrics. 


  * Users who submit ratings of 6 and 8 represent “edge cases” that could be most easily transitioned up to the next, higher NPS category (6→7 = detractor→passive; 8→9 = passive→promotor). To illustrate the strategic importance of targeting these edge cases, below we simulate how small improvements among these users would have an outsized effect on the overall NPS metric for Gtmhub’s platform:
  * If we convert half of the 6’s to 7’s, then NPS score increases 6% (from -32% to -26%).
  * If we convert half of the 8’s to 9’s, then NPS score increases 7% (from -32% to -25%).
  * If we achieve both of the above, then NPS score increases 13% (from -32% to -19%)
* Because of their strategic importance to the NPS calculation, we conducted a more in-depth analysis of these customers’ open-ended text responses to the final survey question: “Is there anything else you would like to add or mention?” The text analysis for these edge cases highlighted two themes — customization and usability — which were also consistent top priorities of the broader customer base we surveyed. To provide more color regarding customization and usability concerns, below are a few representative examples of open-ended comments (Q: “Is there anything else you would like to add or mention?”) from NPS edge-cases: 
  * "needs more friendly customization for the user to use"
  * “it feels more complex than it needs to be — it could be just how we set it up, but it’s really difficult to find my okr’s”
  * “Navigation bar (left): Sorting of Session is not sufficient for our company size”
🟢 💡 Strongly recommend researching and designing ways to increase user engagement beyond one login per week, as Gtmhub platform achieves positive NPS only within this high-usage customer segment.
* Users who log in more than once per week are promoters of the Gtmhub platform (NPS: +4%).
* Users who log in less than once per week are detractors of the Gtmhub platform (NPS: -31% to -25%).
* Users who never log in are even more negative about the Gtmhub platform, almost exclusively detractors (NPS: -93%).

Gtmhub’s Customer Success Team
🟢 💡  Customer Success Team should prioritize customers’ engagement, 
including direct interaction with users at least once/month to maximize NPS.

* NPS for CS Team is +5%, which is 37% higher than NPS for Gtmhub’s platform (-32%)
* NPS for CS Team varies dramatically depending on frequency of interaction with CSM:
  * -25% NPS if interacting with CSM less than once/month
  * +36% NPS if interacting with CSM at least once/month
* Text analysis of customer comments about why they rated CS Team as they did indicate several common pain points related to feeling lack of engagement, clarity, and value (see representative examples below). 
  * “Lack of clarity sometimes”
  * “little value”
  * “I have had zero training and the help tools are not helpful at all. You would think if you had a customer success team, they would offer some sort of monthly or quarterly training for new employees at your clients to learn the platform...” 
* These NPS results and text-based analyses dovetail in recommending that CSMs maintain clear and frequent (at least monthly) communications with customers to promote positive NPS ratings.

Limitations & Delimitations
The 2021 EOY survey received 224 completed submissions, which is ≈3% response rate. Although this is objectively a low response rate, we did see many similar correlations in terminology and pain points to our recent CS/TS ticket analysis, which helps increase the validity of this survey. Further more, research has shown that low response-rate surveys should be considered on their merits as they may accurately represent attitudes of the population, especially if triangulated with other findings. 

It should be noted that there may be some bias due to the vernacular used. This could result in different outputs with more responses. Further evaluation will take place to assist with an increase in response rate going forward (see “Next Steps” below). 

Overall, based on the analyses we were able to conduct, we are confident in our analysis due to the consistency of these NPS metrics (for Gtmhub’s platform) NPS metrics with previous NPS spatial distribution of responses, the numerical distribution of ratings, the wide spectrum of concerns included in customers’ open-ended text comments, the consistency of these results with our recent CS/TS ticket analysis. This is made to help continue our trajectory towards a complete picture and should be taken as one piece of the puzzle.

Next Steps
🎯 Research/design ways to increase user engagement beyond one login per week, as Gtmhub platform achieves positive NPS only within this high-usage customer segment.

🎯 Research ways to increase response rate for future iterations of this End-of-Year survey and other Gtmhub customer surveys. For example, one avenue would be to A/B test multiple versions of the email text.

🎯 Analyze NPS — and potentially other key metrics — as a function of user geography. Note that our survey tool (Qualtrics) automatically collects users’ latitude and longitude, so there is no additional “cost” (respondents’ time) to comprehensively collect this spatial location data from future survey respondents. 
* The map below depicts the location of each respondent in this 2021 EOY survey. From our preliminary spatial analysis, we observe that Gtmhub users responding to this survey are concentrated in the United States and Europe, but also distributed widely throughout the globe.
